Memo is a notecard study tool with question-answer style notecards that aims to boost productivity while studying. Users can create full study sets to study on their own, and even share them for others to discover!

This project was built using Svelte + TailwindCSS on for the frontend and Express + Supabase for the backend. API testing was also written using Vitest framework. 

This project is not yet completed, as I plan to implement generative AI functionality to provide extra insight on their question-answers.
