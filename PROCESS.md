# Build Process

This is my first fully developed web application! It is a CRUD based note taking app that utilizes flashcard formats along with generative AI to give students a more productive study session.

Coming in I was quite indecisive on what my tech stack should be, but I finally settled on using the Svelte library on Vite's framework for the frontend, and express.js for my backend. 

I was torn between separating my frontend and backend frameworks or working in with an integrated framework, but I settled on the former as it aligned more my goals of developing an SPA.

## Tech Stack

Here's a brief overview of what I used to develop my app:
- Node.js
    - passport.js
    - tailwind css
- Vite + Svelte 
- Express.js
